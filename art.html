								<p>Some of my favorite things to do on my free time are taking photos. I am not very good at drawing or painting but for some reason I fell in love with my ability to use a natural gift and capture unique photos. My favorite method of photography is to use darkness to my advantage and control the light that is absorbed through my camera lens to create various pieces of abstract photos. Another name for this method is long exposure photography. The downside about this method is that it take a lot of patience as well as a lot of trial-and-error photos to create a desired result. More than likely, your first photo will not look great but that the fun of it! Over time you will have your own ideas on how you would like to achieve a desired result, and will keep trying until you finally get it! I do not remember where I learned this method, but I think the reason why I liked it most is because it is so unique from anything that I have seen before. I was able to get creative and try different things, which led to results that exceeded my expectations. Below is a showcase of some of my favorite moments I have been able to capture.</p>

								<p>At first this photo did not have the heart developed with the accidental light in the picture. Thankfully Photoshop saved the day.</p>

								<p>In order to have this photo turn out this way, I had to have three people help "paint with light" as my friends in the photo stood still.</p>
